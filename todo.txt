Some features still needed:
- import ROM into selected theme, and match against vanilla_map_id and existing palettes
- Swap tiles (within and between palettes), updating area data
- Ctrl-R to rebuild all the PNG (in case palette was changed, which could affect everything).
- Way to open a second area/scratch in side panel (instead of palette/tileset editor)
- when closing/opening editor, remember which areas were open.
- overlays
- World editor
- Export to ROM
- add status bar to show cursor position & tile info? (e.g. palette, tile number, collision type, flip)
  - right clicking can show most of this info, but for a broken palette it won't be available.
- show preview of brush onto tileset
