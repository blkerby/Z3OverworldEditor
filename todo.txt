Some features still needed:
- Import from ROM: palettes, tiles, and areas
- export PNG
- Swap tiles (within and between palettes), updating area data
- Undo
- Way to open a second area/scratch in side panel (instead of palette/tileset editor)
- Include collision & reflectability data
- World editor
- Export to ROM
