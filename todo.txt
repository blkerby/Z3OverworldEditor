Some features still needed:
- show palettes used by room
- used different key instead of CTRL for identifying tiles/colors
- Swap tiles (within and between palettes), updating area data
- Way to open a second area/scratch in side panel (instead of palette/tileset editor)
- overlays
- World editor
- Export to ROM
- add status bar to show cursor position & tile info? (e.g. palette, tile number, collision type, flip)
  - right clicking can show most of this info, but for a broken palette it won't be available.
