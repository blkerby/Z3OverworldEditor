Some features still needed:
- Select/brush multiple palette colors at once
- Swap tiles (within and between palettes), updating screen data
- Undo
- Import from ROM: palettes, tiles, and screens
- Way to open a second screen/scratch in side panel (instead of palette/tileset editor)
- Collision data
- World editor
- Export to ROM
