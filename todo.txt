Some features still needed:
- fix BG color import with vanilla-type ROM
- when closing/opening editor, remember which areas were open.
- import animated tiles
- overlays
- World editor
- Export to ROM
- add status bar to show cursor position & tile info? (e.g. palette, tile number, collision type, flip)
  - right clicking can show most of this info, but for a broken palette it won't be available.
- show preview of brush onto tileset (and hover)

Bugs to fix:
- pixel brush loses mouse release when OOB
- pixel brush debounce isn't working?
